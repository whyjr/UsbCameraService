# UsbCameraService
This is only a sample for showing the implemention of controlling the Preview of Camera in our device,here I use a self-define View and 
a Window to show the video data from camera to client. There are still some function that you should be careful:  
(1) The operation of opening Camera can be optimized  
(2) The code for showing camera data by GLSurfaceView are still updating, it is not available now
